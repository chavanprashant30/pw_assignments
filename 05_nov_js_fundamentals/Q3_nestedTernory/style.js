// Q3).Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print
// “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

// Ans:

let number = 11;
const noType =
number > 0  
    ? "Positive"
    : number < 0
    ? "Negative"
    : "Zero"

    console.log(noType);
