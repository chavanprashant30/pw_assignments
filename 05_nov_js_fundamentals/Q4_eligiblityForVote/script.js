// Q4).Use a ternary operator to check that a person is eligible to vote or not by checking his age. If the age of the
// person is less than 18 then “You cannot vote” should be logged else “You can vote” should be logged.

// Ans:

const age = 2;

const result = age > 18 ? "can Vote" : "Can't Vote";

console.log("You", result);
