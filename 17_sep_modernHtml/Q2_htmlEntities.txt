HTML Character Entities : 

    Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with entities:
        < (less than) = &lt;
        > (greather than) = &gt;

    Some characters are reserved in HTML.

    If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.

    Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

    Entity names look like this:

    &entity_name;

    &lt; - Represents the less-than symbol <.
    Example: <p>This is an example &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;.</p>
    &gt; - Represents the greater-than symbol >.
    Example: <p>For more information, visit our website &gt; <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
    &amp; - Represents the ampersand symbol &.
    Example: <p>For further details, contact us &amp; we'll assist you.</p>
    &quot; - Represents a double quotation mark "
    Example: <p>The title of the book is "The Great Gatsby".</p>
    &copy; - Represents the copyright symbol Â©.
    Example: <p>&copy; 2023 ACME Corporation. All rights reserved.</p>
