Q5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments?

Ans:
    Comments in JavaScript are essential for code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers. They serve several important purposes:

    1.Documentation:
        Comments provide explanations and context about the code's purpose, logic, and
        functionality. This makes it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and work with the code.

    2.Debugging:
        Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" code during debugging
        helping you isolate issues without deleting code.

    3.Communication;
        Comments allow developers to communicate with each other, explaining why certain
        decisions were made or describing how specific code segments work.

    4.Orgenization:
        Comments can be used to divide code into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and maintain larer code bases.

    5.Legel and Complience:
        In some cases, comments may be required to explain licensing, copyright information, or compliance with regulations.

    -Single-line Comment:
        Use double slashes (//) to create single-line comments. Anything after // on the same
        line is considered a comment and is not executed by the JavaScript interpreter.

            // This is a single-line comment
            let age = 30; // This comment explains the variable's purpose

    Multi-line Comment:
        Use /* to begin a multi-line comment and */ to end it. Everything between these symbols is treated as a comment, allowing you to write comments spanning multiple lines.

            /*
            This is a multi-line comment.
            It can provide detailed explanations for code blocks.
            */

            function calculateArea(width, height) {
                return width * height;
            }

    Keep in mind that while comments are valuable, it's also important to maintain them and ensure they stay up to date with changes in the code. Clear and well-maintained comment can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of your JavaScript code.
